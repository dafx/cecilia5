# Cecilia5 #

Cecilia is an audio signal processing environment. Cecilia lets you create your own GUI (grapher, sliders, toggles, popup menus) using a simple syntax. Cecilia comes with many original builtin modules for sound effects and synthesis.

Previously written in tcl/tk, Cecilia (version 4, deprecated) was entirely rewritten in Python/wxPython and uses the Csound API for communicating between the interface and the audio engine. Version 4.2 is the final release of version 4.

Cecilia5 now uses the pyo audio engine created for the Python programming language. pyo allows a much more powerfull integration of the audio engine to the graphical interface. Since it's a standard python module, there is no need to use an API to communicate with the interface.
